# Receiving Code Review

## Overview

Receiving a review is not the same as agreeing with it.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The 6-Step Pattern

Process ALL feedback before implementing ANY of it:

```
1. READ       — Complete feedback without reacting. Do not implement mid-read.
2. UNDERSTAND — Restate each item in your own words. Cannot restate = ask first.
3. VERIFY     — Check the codebase. Does the problem actually exist at file:line?
4. EVALUATE   — Technically correct for THIS stack? YAGNI? Conflicts prior decision?
5. RESPOND    — Clarify unclear items. Push back on incorrect ones. Acknowledge valid ones.
6. IMPLEMENT  — One item at a time, test each. Fix order: blocking → simple → complex.
```

**Forbidden:**
- "You're absolutely right!" / "Great point!" / "Thanks for catching that!" (performative)
- Starting implementation before finishing full read
- Implementing anything you cannot restate in your own words

**Instead:** Restate the requirement, or just act — code shows you heard the feedback.

## Handling Unclear Feedback

If ANY item is unclear: **STOP. Do not implement anything yet.**

```
your partner: "Fix items 1-6"
You understand 1, 2, 3, 6. Unclear on 4, 5.

❌ Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
✅ "Understand 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

Partial understanding → wrong implementation. Items may be related.

## Source-Specific Handling

**From human partner (internal):**
- Trusted — implement after understanding
- Still ask if scope is unclear or conflicts with a prior decision
- Skip to action or technical acknowledgment (no gratitude)

**From external reviewers (CI, automated tools, external PRs):**
```
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Technically correct for THIS stack/version?
  2. Breaks existing functionality or tests?
  3. Why does the current implementation exist?
  4. Does the reviewer understand the full context?

IF conflicts with human partner's prior decisions → stop and discuss first
IF can't verify → "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"
```

## YAGNI Check (Before "Professional" Suggestions)

When a reviewer suggests adding abstraction, proper patterns, or extra features:

```
grep codebase → is this actually used more than once?

IF unused: "Grepped codebase — nothing calls this. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
IF speculative: "This is used once. Per code-standards.md I'd keep it simple
                 unless we have a concrete second use case. Override?"
IF used: implement properly
```

## When to Push Back

Push back (technical reasoning, not refusal) when feedback:
- Breaks existing functionality or test coverage
- Conflicts with an established architectural decision (reference the plan or ADR)
- Conflicts with a prior instruction from the human partner
- Is technically incorrect for the framework/version in use (check MCP docs)
- Is speculative YAGNI — the feature does not exist in the codebase
- Adds complexity that `code-standards.md` explicitly forbids

**Format:**
```
"Not implementing [X] because [concrete reason + evidence at file:line].
 Proposed alternative: [Y if applicable].
 Do you want to override?"
```

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

```
✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed at file:line]"
✅ "Good catch — [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ [Just fix it and show the diff]

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ ANY gratitude expression
```

Actions speak. The fix itself shows you heard the feedback.

## Correcting a Wrong Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:
```
✅ "You were right — checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified and you're correct. My initial read was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually. Move on.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |
| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |
| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if it breaks things |
| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify ALL items first |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State the limitation, ask for direction |

## Integration

- Use after: `/review-code`, SDD pipeline (after quality reviewer responds), any PR review
- Pairs with: `requesting-code-review` skill (send path → receive path)
- References: `core-behaviors.md` §4 Simplicity, §5 Scope Discipline; `code-standards.md` DRY/YAGNI
- GitHub replies: use inline thread replies, not top-level PR comments
  (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies`)
