# PR Review (Two-Stage)

## Iron Law

**NO PR COMMENT POSTED WITHOUT HUMAN APPROVAL FIRST**

Generate internally. Review locally. Approve explicitly. Post to GitHub.

## Why Two Stages

Internal analysis uses rich formatting (emojis, line numbers, full context) optimized for thorough reasoning. Public comments use clean professional language optimized for the PR author. Mixing them leaks internal noise and draft thinking onto GitHub.

## Stage 1 — Internal Analysis

### Step 1: Fetch PR Data

```bash
# PR metadata
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json number,title,body,author,additions,deletions,changedFiles

# Full diff
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>

# Existing comments and reviews
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments,reviews

# CI status
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>
```

### Step 2: Analyze

Read `references/pr-review-checklist.md` and evaluate the PR against all categories.

Optionally run `/review-pr` command on the diff to get structured 6-role findings before writing.

### Step 3: Generate Two Files

**`pr/review.md`** — Internal rich format (never posted):
- Use 🔴🟡🟢 severity markers
- Include code snippets with file:line references
- Write reasoning notes freely — this is for you, not the author
- No length limit; be thorough

**`pr/human.md`** — Public clean format (posted after approval):
- Professional, constructive tone
- No emojis, no file:line references, no internal notes
- Lead with one positive observation
- Group issues: Blocking -> Important -> Suggestions
- End with clear decision: Approve / Request Changes / Comment

## Gate — Human Review

Before Stage 2, open both files:

```bash
open pr/review.md   # or: code pr/review.md
open pr/human.md
```

Edit `pr/human.md` as needed. This is the last chance before GitHub sees anything.

## Stage 2 — Public Posting

Choose the appropriate action:

```bash
# Approve the PR + post your comment
gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --approve --body "$(cat pr/human.md)"

# Request changes + post your comment
gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --request-changes --body "$(cat pr/human.md)"

# Comment only (no approve/reject decision)
gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment --body "$(cat pr/human.md)"
```

## Inline Comments (Optional)

For specific line-level feedback, create `pr/inline.md` with one `gh api` command per comment. Post each one selectively after Stage 2 — pick only the ones you agree with.

See `references/pr-review-workflow.md` for the full inline comment command format.

## File Structure

```
pr/
  review.md      <- Internal rich analysis (NEVER posted to GitHub)
  human.md       <- Public clean version (posted after human approval)
  inline.md      <- Optional per-line comments (posted selectively)
```
