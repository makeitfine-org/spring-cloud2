# Security Review Checklist

## Scan Categories

### 1. Secrets Detection (CRITICAL)
- No hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, or connection strings in source code
- Secrets loaded from environment variables or secret managers only
- No secrets in git history (check with grep/trufflehog if suspicious)
- **Never paste real API keys, tokens, or credentials into AI chat interfaces** (Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot). Use `process.env.VAR_NAME` placeholders in prompts. AI providers may log conversations — treat chat input as a public channel.
- `.env` files in `.gitignore`

### 2. Injection Prevention (CRITICAL)
- All SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation with user input)
- No command injection via `exec`/`spawn` with unsanitized input
- No NoSQL injection in MongoDB/Firestore queries
- ORMs used safely (no raw queries with user input)

### 3. Authentication & Authorization (CRITICAL)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2 (never plaintext comparison)
- JWT tokens properly validated (signature, expiry, issuer)
- Authorization checked on every route/endpoint (not just authentication)
- **Client-side guards are UX, NOT security.** Angular route guards, Flutter widget visibility checks, and UI-level role hiding do NOT enforce authorization. All authorization MUST be enforced server-side. Anyone can call your API directly.
- No IDOR -- users cannot access other users' resources by changing IDs
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (login, register, password reset)
- Session management secure (httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies)
- **Prefer managed auth providers** (Firebase Auth, Auth0, Clerk) over custom JWT implementations for production apps. Custom auth with bcrypt+Passport is acceptable for learning/demo projects only. Managed providers handle token rotation, MFA, account recovery, and security patches automatically.

### 4. Input Validation & Output Encoding (HIGH)
- All user inputs validated and sanitized server-side
- XSS prevention: output escaped, Content-Security-Policy header set
- File uploads validated (type, size, content) and stored outside webroot
- URL inputs validated against allowlist to prevent SSRF

### 5. Data Protection (HIGH)
- HTTPS enforced; no mixed content
- PII encrypted at rest; sensitive data not logged
- Error messages do not expose internal details or stack traces
- Security headers set (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP)
- CORS configured with specific origins (not wildcard in production)

### 6. Dependencies (HIGH)
- **Verify every package before installing:** Check npm/PyPI download count (>1K weekly), last publish date (<12 months), verify package name matches intended (typosquatting defense: `lodash` not `lodash-utils`). For AI-suggested packages, verify the package actually exists on the registry before running `npm install` / `pip install`.
- `npm audit` / `pip audit` / dependency-check clean of critical/high CVEs
- No deprecated or unmaintained packages in critical paths
- Lock files committed; dependencies pinned

### 7. Financial/Transaction Security (CRITICAL, when applicable)
- Financial operations use atomic transactions with row locks
- No race conditions in balance checks (check-then-act patterns)
- No floating-point arithmetic for money (use integer cents or Decimal)
- Audit logging for all money movements
- Rate limiting on financial endpoints

### 8. Database Security (HIGH)
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on multi-tenant tables
- No direct database access from client
- Database credentials not hardcoded; rotated regularly
- **Secret rotation schedule enforced:** All secrets (API keys, DB passwords, JWT signing keys, service account keys) rotated every 90 days maximum. Use calendar reminders or automated rotation (GCP Secret Manager auto-rotation, AWS Secrets Manager rotation lambdas). Rotation must be zero-downtime: deploy new secret → verify → revoke old secret.
- Parameterized queries only

### 9. Logging & Monitoring (MEDIUM)
- Security events logged (failed logins, authorization failures, input validation errors)
- No sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Alerts configured for anomalous patterns
- **Mandatory audit triggers:** Audit log required for: record deletions, role/permission changes, payment events, data exports, account modifications, admin actions. If a critical action has no audit trail, flag it as HIGH severity.

## Anti-Patterns to Always Flag

- Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- String-concatenated SQL/commands with user input
- `innerHTML` with unsanitized user input
- Plaintext password storage or comparison
- Missing authorization checks on endpoints
- `fetch(userProvidedUrl)` without URL validation
- `GRANT ALL` or overly permissive database roles
- Race conditions in financial operations (check-then-act without locks)
- Disabled security features in production (debug mode, permissive CORS)
- Logging passwords, tokens, or API keys

## Common False Positives

- Credentials in `.env.example` (placeholder values, not real secrets)
- Test credentials clearly marked in test files
- Public/publishable API keys (e.g., Stripe publishable key)
- SHA256/MD5 used for checksums, not password hashing

## Output Format

Report findings grouped by severity (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW) with:
- File location and line number
- Vulnerability category (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Hardcoded Secret)
- Issue description and impact
- Recommended fix

End with the security checklist showing pass/fail status and an overall risk level (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW).
