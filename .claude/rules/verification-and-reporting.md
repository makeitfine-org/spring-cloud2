# Verification and Status Reporting

## Verify Before Claiming

Actually check code before saying "missing" or "implemented". Don't guess. Don't flip when challenged.

### Before ANY claim about code state:

1. FIND the specific file(s) where it should exist
2. READ the actual code (not just file names)
3. TRACE the full implementation (UI → service → data)
4. ONLY THEN make a claim

### Required format:

```
## Feature: [Name]
### Verification:
- UI Component: [file:line] or ❌ NOT FOUND
- Service/Logic: [file:line] or ❌ NOT FOUND
- Data Connection: [file:line] or ❌ NOT FOUND
### Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED / ❌ MISSING / ⚠️ PARTIAL (requires per-layer evidence above)
### Evidence: [Actual code snippet or function signature]
```

### Spec Conformance (when plan/spec exists for this feature):

```
- Completeness: All WHEN/THEN scenarios from spec covered? [YES/NO — list uncovered]
- Correctness: Behavior matches spec intent, not just "code exists"? [YES/NO — evidence]
- Coherence: Design decisions from plan reflected in code structure? [YES/NO — evidence]
- Constraints: All non-functional requirements met? [YES/NO — list violated]
```

> Skip this section if no spec/plan document exists for the feature being verified.

### When User Challenges Your Analysis

Don't flip. Re-verify:

```
"Let me re-verify by actually reading the code..."
[Actually read the files]
"I found [X] at [file:line]. My initial analysis was wrong because
I didn't check [specific thing]."

OR

"I re-verified and my initial analysis was correct.
Here's the evidence: [show what you searched, what's not there]"
```

**Forbidden:** "I believe it's..." / "It should be in..." — either you verified or you didn't.

---

## Honest Status Reporting

### Forbidden:

- "Feature is 95% complete" → then listing critical blocking issues
- "Mostly functional" → then describing why it doesn't work
- Vague qualifiers: "mostly", "almost", "nearly", "partially" (note: ⚠️ PARTIAL in verification template is allowed because it requires per-layer file:line evidence — the ban is on "partially" as a hand-wave without proof)
- Percentage estimates that contradict the details

### Required:

- Binary status: "Works" or "Doesn't work"
- If broken: "X works, Y is broken because Z"
- Details must match the summary

### Format:

```
What WORKS:
- [Feature A]: ✅ User can do X, Y, Z end-to-end

What's BROKEN:
- [Feature B]: ❌ Clicking does X instead of Y
```

### Self-Check Before Reporting:

1. Did I say something "works" or is "functional"?
2. Did I then list reasons why it doesn't work?
3. If yes → REWRITE with honest, non-contradictory status
4. **Principal engineer check:** Would a principal engineer approve this if they reviewed your diff? If not — what would they flag? Fix it before reporting done.

## Action Claims Require Evidence

Status updates about actions (not just code state) must include proof:

| Claim | Required Evidence |
|-------|------------------|
| "Started server/service" | PID, port, or startup log output |
| "Running tests" | Command + output (pass/fail count) |
| "Deployed/launched" | URL, response, or deployment log |
| "Fixed the bug" | Test that failed before, passes now |
| "Installed dependency" | Package manager output or lockfile diff |

**Forbidden:** "Working on it" / "Done" without corresponding tool output in the same response.

**Rule:** The claim and its evidence must appear in the same message. No forward promises. A false completion is worse than a delayed honest answer.

---

## Plan Execution Completeness

When a plan is approved, implement 100%. Not 60%. Not "most of it." ALL of it.

### Before saying "done":

```
□ Item 1 from plan → Implemented? [YES/NO]
□ Item 2 from plan → Implemented? [YES/NO]
□ Item 3 from plan → Implemented? [YES/NO]
If ANY item is NO → Do NOT say "done"
```

### If you cannot complete an item:

```
STOP and say:
"I cannot complete [item] because [reason].
Options:
1. Try a different approach
2. Skip this item (with your approval)
3. Stop here and discuss"
```

**Never** silently skip plan items. **Never** defer without explicit approval.

## Quality Gates

Before declaring any workflow type complete, the following gates must pass. These are minimum bars — do not skip them.

### Feature / PR Gate
- [ ] All existing tests pass (run them — don't assume)
- [ ] New logic has at least one test covering the happy path
- [ ] `security-reviewer` agent has been run on changed files
- [ ] No new unused imports, variables, or functions introduced
- [ ] `npm audit --audit-level=high` (Node.js) or `pip audit` (Python) or `mvn dependency-check:check` (Java) — zero critical/high CVEs
- [ ] Change description written (CHANGES MADE / THINGS I DIDN'T TOUCH / POTENTIAL CONCERNS)

### Architecture Gate
- [ ] ADR (Architecture Decision Record) created for the key tech choice
- [ ] `architect` agent or `/design-architecture` command was used
- [ ] API contracts defined before implementation starts
- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced

### Database Schema Gate
- [ ] Migration is reversible (has both up and down)
- [ ] Indexes defined for expected query patterns
- [ ] `postgresql-database-reviewer` agent run on migration files
- [ ] No direct table drops without explicit human approval

### UI / Design System Gate
- [ ] No hardcoded colors — all colors use theme tokens (Flutter: `colorScheme`, Angular: daisyUI semantic)
- [ ] No raw spacing values — all spacing uses semantic tokens (Flutter: `AppSpacing`, Angular: Tailwind scale)
- [ ] No inline TextStyles — all typography uses theme text styles
- [ ] Touch targets >= 48dp (Flutter) / 44px (Angular) for interactive elements
- [ ] `/lint-design-system` run with zero violations
- [ ] Exception markers (`// ignore-design: [reason]`) reviewed and justified

### Release / Merge Gate
- [ ] `/review-code` run and issues addressed
- [ ] `/audit-security` run with no Critical findings unresolved
- [ ] CLAUDE.md tech stack versions still accurate
- [ ] No TODOs or stub implementations in changed files

**If ANY gate item is NO → do NOT declare done. State which gate items are open.**
